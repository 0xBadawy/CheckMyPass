# Password Strength Analyzer ✬✬✬

## Project Overview

This project is a **Password Strength Analyzer** designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on various factors. It assesses the length, complexity, entropy, and common patterns (such as dictionary words and sequential characters). The tool also provides recommendations for creating stronger passwords.

## Features

- **Length Evaluation**: Checks if the password meets the minimum recommended length.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates if the password contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the randomness of the password using entropy.
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies common patterns such as dictionary words, sequential characters (e.g., "1234" or "abcd"), and repeated characters.
- **Strength Rating**: Provides an overall password strength rating (Weak, Medium, Strong).
- **Recommendations**: Suggests improvements for creating a stronger password.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: For building the user interface and handling the dynamic elements.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components with a utility-first CSS framework.
